If the task is multistep forecasting, we use e.g. 24 hours as input data and the next 24 hours as target values so that a data window contains 48 hours. For example, the 1st window uses 48 hours starting from the 1st hour, the 2nd window uses 48 hours starting from the 2nd hour and so on. We can create batches using a certain number of data windows, e.g. 32 data windows. The order for each data window cannot be changed but the order of the data windows in a batch can be shuffled."
